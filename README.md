# BashAPIApp
An application primarily for streamers, that saves a gamerscore.txt file to a chosen directory.
This allows users to pipe this file into their favorite streaming software to keep an up-to-date display of their gamerscore on screen.

To use you must have an account with https://xboxapi.com and must link it to your XBox account. I recommend a polling rate of 45 seconds or higher to prevent going over the free account limitations.
On your XBoxAPI account page, after linking your XBox account, you will have an API key that must be placed in the program's configuration window.
